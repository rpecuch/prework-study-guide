# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide was created to provide an organized platform for students to view notes from prework. This project was built not only to review key points from lessons, but the process itself was a learning experience in learning basic coding concepts. I learned about the basic components required to build a webpage and how they all work together. I plan to implement new features as I learn new skills when class begins.

Notes for the different topics are divided into four sections entitled "HTML", "CSS", "Git", and "JavaScript". Scroll down to the desired section to review the notes. For a suggestion on which topic to study first, open the Chrome DevTools console by using Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console should appear with a suggested topic listed at the bottom. To have another topic suggested, simply refresh the browser.
